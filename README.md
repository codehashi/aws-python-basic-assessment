# Technical assessment

This small set of exercises is intended to test some abilities as a backend developer on AWS and Python. Please create a mirror into a private repository and share it through our e-mail.

## Exercise 1

Make a graph representing the data below, using Pythonâ€™s library Networkx, and display it on Matplot. Data:
```
 A -> B
 A -> C
 C -> D
```

Add the source code (one single Python file) to this repository.


## Exercise 2

Create a multi-stage Dockerfile for a simple python script containing Matplot and Graphviz dependencies and applying some best practices (e.g. minimal size). Add only the Dockerfile to this repository. It doesn't need to be fully completed or production-ready, just add some comments in the file, explaining the main decisions taken.


## Exercise 3

Generate a Docker image named "exercise3" and push it to the AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR). Take a screenshort of the repository at the web console and add the screeenshot file to this repository.
